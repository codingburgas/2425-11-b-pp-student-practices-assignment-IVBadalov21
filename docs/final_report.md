## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Perceptron Algorithm Design

#### 2.1.1 Algorithm Architecture
The system implements a multi-class Perceptron using the one-vs-all approach:
- **Five binary classifiers:** One for each target language
- **Training method:** Perceptron learning rule with weight updates
- **Prediction:** Highest confidence score determines final classification
- **Features:** 50+ dimensional feature vector per text sample

#### 2.1.2 Mathematical Foundation
```
For each classifier i:
- Weight update: w_i = w_i + η(y_i - ŷ_i) * x
- Prediction: ŷ_i = sign(w_i · x + b_i)
- Confidence: conf_i = |w_i · x + b_i|
```

Where:
- `η` = learning rate (0.01)
- `y_i` = actual label (1 if language i, -1 otherwise)
- `ŷ_i` = predicted label
- `x` = feature vector
- `w_i` = weight vector for language i
- `b_i` = bias term for language i

#### 2.1.3 Feature Engineering
The system extracts comprehensive linguistic features:

**Character-level Features (20 features):**
- Frequency of common letters (a-z)
- Character distribution patterns
- Punctuation usage statistics

**N-gram Features (15 features):**
- Bigram frequencies for language-specific patterns
- Trigram analysis for common word endings
- Character sequence probabilities

**Language-specific Markers (10 features):**
- Cyrillic character detection (Bulgarian)
- Diacritical mark frequency (German, Spanish, French)
- Language-specific punctuation patterns

**Statistical Features (8 features):**
- Vowel-to-consonant ratios
- Average word length
- Sentence structure patterns
- Text complexity metrics
