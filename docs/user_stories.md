## Language Detector - Project #12

### Epic: Language Detection System
**As a user, I want to detect the language of text samples so that I can identify which of the 5 supported languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Bulgarian) a text is written in.**

### Core User Stories

#### 1. Text Input and Language Detection
**As a user, I want to input text and get language predictions**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - User can enter text in a text area
  - System provides language prediction with confidence scores
  - Results show percentage confidence for each language
  - Character count is displayed in real-time
  - Clear visual feedback for the predicted language

#### 2. User Registration and Authentication
**As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access personalized features**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - User can register with username, email, and password
  - Email confirmation is required before full access
  - User can log in and log out securely
  - Password reset functionality is available
  - User profile displays personal information

#### 3. Prediction History
**As a registered user, I want to view my prediction history so that I can track my usage**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - User can see all previous predictions
  - History shows input text, predicted language, and confidence
  - Results can be filtered and sorted
  - Pagination for large result sets
  - Option to make predictions public or private

#### 4. Survey Contribution System
**As a user, I want to contribute training data so that I can help improve the model**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - User can submit text samples with known languages
  - System validates and stores contributions
  - Confidence scores are calculated for submissions
  - Users receive feedback on contribution quality
  - Language examples are provided for guidance

#### 5. Admin Dashboard
**As an admin, I want to manage the system so that I can oversee users and model performance**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Admin can view all users and their statistics
  - Admin can approve/reject survey contributions
  - System metrics and model performance are displayed
  - User management capabilities (edit, delete, confirm)
  - Training data management and quality control

#### 6. API Access
**As a developer, I want API access so that I can integrate language detection into other applications**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - RESTful API endpoints for language prediction
  - JSON response format with confidence scores
  - Rate limiting and authentication for API access
  - Clear API documentation and examples
  - Error handling and status codes

### Technical User Stories

#### 7. Multi-Script Support
**As a user, I want to input text in different scripts so that I can detect Cyrillic and Latin-based languages**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - System handles Unicode text properly
  - Cyrillic script (Bulgarian) is fully supported
  - Accented characters in European languages work correctly
  - Character encoding issues are handled gracefully

#### 8. Model Performance
**As a user, I want accurate predictions so that I can trust the language detection results**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Custom Perceptron algorithm provides competitive accuracy
  - Training metrics are tracked and displayed
  - Model can be retrained with new data
  - Performance benchmarks are documented
  - Feature extraction is optimized for the 5 target languages

#### 9. Responsive Web Interface
**As a user, I want a responsive interface so that I can use the system on different devices**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Interface works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
  - Bootstrap-based responsive design
  - Touch-friendly controls for mobile users

  - Accessible design following web standards

### Priority Classification
- **High Priority:** Stories 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- **Medium Priority:** Stories 4, 7, 9
- **Low Priority:** Stories 6

### Story Points Estimation
- Story 1: 8 points (Core functionality)
- Story 2: 5 points (Standard auth system)
- Story 3: 3 points (Database queries and display)
- Story 4: 5 points (Data collection system)
- Story 5: 8 points (Complex admin features)
- Story 6: 3 points (API endpoints)
- Story 7: 5 points (Unicode handling complexity)
